# üöÄ Welcome to Browser Agent\!

This project is a web-based agent application bundled with Webpack.

-----

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

  * **Node.js** (v18 or higher is recommended)
  * **pnpm**: A fast and efficient package manager. See the [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).
  * **protoc**: The Protobuf compiler. This is only required if you need to modify and re-compile the `smmp.proto` file.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [project_folder_name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use `pnpm` to install all the required packages.

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

-----

## üíª Running the Development Server

This project uses `webpack-dev-server` for the development environment, which supports Hot Reloading for an improved workflow. Use the appropriate command for your target environment.

  * **Run the dev server for the MCC environment:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run serve_mcc
    ```

  * **Run the dev server for the AIVN environment:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run serve_aivn
    ```

Once the server is running, you can access the application at the address shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8080`).

-----

## üì¶ Building for Production

To bundle and optimize the project for deployment, use the following build commands.

  * **Production Build (Recommended):**
    This command minifies and optimizes the code for the final deployment.

    ```bash
    pnpm run build:prod
    ```

  * **Development Build:**
    This command builds the project with source maps for easier debugging.

    ```bash
    pnpm run build:dev
    ```

After the build is complete, the output files will be generated in the `dist` folder (this may vary depending on your Webpack configuration).

-----

## üåê Deployment

Deployment involves uploading the static files generated by the production build to a web server or hosting service.

#### **General Deployment Steps**

1.  **Run the production build:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build:prod
    ```
2.  **Upload the build artifacts:**
    Upload all files from the generated `dist` folder (`index.html`, `main.js`, etc.) to a static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, or your own server.

## ‚ú® Re-compiling Protobuf Bindings

If you modify the `smmp.proto` file in the project's root directory, you must re-generate the `smmp.d.ts` and `smmp.js` files by running the following command. This makes the changes available in TypeScript.

```bash
protoc -I=. --ts_out=. smmp.proto
```
